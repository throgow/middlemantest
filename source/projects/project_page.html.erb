Hi all!

I'm currently re-building my portfolio (and learning middleman along the way to simplify things) but having trouble setting up things exactly the way I want them. I've gone through all the docs and googled, but can't really find the answer I'm looking for, so thought I'd try here:

This overall structure of the site:

* A landing page, listing projects from a json file.

* A project page layout where I want to inject an image, project title and project description fmor json.

Using the proxy method config.rb, I've been able to create I can't seem to find a way to dynamically create pages
